            <div>The Indian Traditional Drum</div>
            <div><p>The drums that are used in India and around the world are all specialities and usually reflect the culture of a country or the region where they were created. They can be played individually, such as a Dholki or in groups, like Tabla. Sometimes, there may be more than two drums, such as in rock band drum kits.
                    The oldest drums date back to 4000 B.C. and originated in Egypt. Archaeological excavations and studies indicate that the drums were first made using alligator skins and were found in Neolithic cultures of China. These drums were used for ritual ceremonies.
                    he initial design included the cymbals. These were the drums that were originally used in China and Turkey and were made from metal.

                <div><img src="Resources/sub_Tambourine.jpg" alt=""/></div>
                <div><p>India is also credited with the development of Tambourine. These originated a few centuries later. The tambourines were designed as a piece of entertainment. They could be played by stroking or shaking the jingles or by striking them sharply. The drum was developed to please the kings and provide entertainment in the king’s court. 
                        Since 100 B.C. India has been using the Dholak and Dholki as well. These instruments bear a striking resemblance to the modern day bass drums. But unlike bass drums which are usually sounded for wars, for military parades and other purposes, Dholak and Dholki are used for celebration.
