The word "tambour" ("drum" in French) is from Oriental origin, and even the snare (of the "snare drum") can be found on the Moroccan tambourines (in the form of dried gut, as the European military drums up at last century) the "bendirs." Tambourine (low-deep wooden cylinder with single skin) is found in various forms in the oldest traditional cultures around the world, which lets imagine that it is one of the oldest percussion instruments......<span>"</span></p></div>

                    <div> <p><span>"</span>Some historians believe that the word "jazz" comes from the French slang word "jaser" (pronounced "jazze" and meaning "to chat" or simply "jazz" for "il jase" meaning "he chats"), which may characterize the dialogue engaged by the soloists who improvise in the "New Orleans" music style. The most famous of these groups, the first to record with a real modern drumset (in 1923 in Chicago) and claims to be the first real jazz band, is that of Joe "King" Oliver (playing since the 1910s): the "King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band" (founded in 1922), where Louis Armstrong will illustrate, trumpeter and singer then beginner, Warren "Baby" Dodds (photo), the first recorded jazz drummer<span>"</span></p></div>

Kenny Clarke is also one of the first to use large Turkish cymbals (later called "ride") to mark the chabada, instead of using only the hi-hat or snare drum.<span>"</span></p></div>
